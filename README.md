Check your lungs, exactly what it means.
Currently, the AI model could not be connected to this app directly. However, I did make a middleman API in order to connect Vertex to the app. 
Unfortunately, although the python fetch command does work as expected, javascript fetch refused to work and I could not find a fix in time.
Demo of the ML model can be found at https://github.com/BasicallyOk/HackHer_API_Wrapper
